============
NOTES and BUGS

This module will configure DHCP with a fallback lease for the current
IP address of the host.

The 'interfaces' file templates use a case statement to interate over
the most common interface names. It may need to be extended for additional
interface types, particularly the FreeBSD template.
(There must be a better way to do that...)

I can only detect the first default route.

CARP, VRRP, and virtual VLAN interfaces aren't managed here.

TODO: Move DHCP and, maybe, Interfaces file to a new class. Or rename this class to reflect it's real purpose.
