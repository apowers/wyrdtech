This modules configures basic information that a host needs to boot
with a valid network configuration.

* Common packages
* Network interface configuration
* dhclient configuration
* /etc/skel files
* Universal directories like '/home'.

============
NOTES and BUGS

This module will configure DHCP with a fallback lease for the current
IP address of the host.

The 'interfaces' file templates use a case statement to interate over
the most common interface names. It may need to be extended for additional
interface types, particularly the FreeBSD template.
(There must be a better way to do that...)

Default route logic is very basic. Only the first default route in the routing table will be recognized.
It will be added to the dhclient.conf and interfaces file for the first interface.

CARP, VRRP, and virtual VLAN interfaces aren't managed here.

BUGS: Assigning a static address assumes that the current IP address of the system is correct, which may cause
    trouble if the IP address of the host changes.

TODO: Move DHCP and, maybe, Interfaces file to a new class. Or rename this class to reflect it's real purpose.
