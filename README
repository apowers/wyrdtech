Basic host configuration.

* Network interface configuration
* dhclient configuration
* Common packages
* /etc/skel files
* Common directories like '/home'.

Written for puppet 3.1, not tested with puppet 2.x

== NOTES

For non-static interfaces, this module will configure DHCP-client with a
fallback lease for the current IP address of the host.

The 'interfaces' file templates use a case statement to interate over
the most common interface names. It may need to be extended for additional
interface types, particularly the FreeBSD template.
(There must be a better way to do that...)

CARP, VLAN, and virtual interfaces are ignored.

Assigning a static address assumes that the current IP address of the system is
correct, which may cause trouble if the IP address of the host changes.

Default route logic is very basic. Only the first default route in the routing
table will be recognized.
