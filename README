# Abandoned #

This was my first module. I have since abandoned it in favor
of several modules that do more specific things. 

# Description #

Basic host configuration.

* Network interface configuration
* dhclient configuration
* Common packages
* /etc/skel files
* Common directories like '/home'.

# Compatibility #

Paramaterized and hiera compatible.

Written for puppet 3.x, not tested with puppet 2.x

Supports Debian and FreeBSD with CentOS and others coming soon.

# Notes #

For non-static interfaces (default), this module will configure DHCP-client
with a fallback lease for the current IP address of the host.

CARP, VLAN, and virtual interfaces are ignored.

Assigning a static address assumes that the current IP address of the system is
correct and will be used in the dhclient and interfaces configuration.

Default route logic is very basic. Only the first default route in the routing
table will be recognized.

# Hiera YAML #

* String: $basichost::resolv_conf['domain']
* String: $basichost::resolv_conf['search']
* Array: $basichost::resolv_conf['nameservers']
* Array: $basichost::directories
* Array: $basichost::packages
* Bool: $basichost::static_address[<interface_name>]

    basichost::resolv_conf:
    domain: ''
    search: ''
    nameservers:
    - ''
    - ''

    basichost::directories:
    - ''

    basichost::packages:
    - ''

    basichost::static_address:
    <interface_name>: <true|false>

# TODO #

* CentOS support.
* MS Windows support?
* SmartOS support?
* Even if all interfaces are "static", dhclient will still be started. That might be a problem.
